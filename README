BattleshipBot
=====================================

BattleshipBot will suggest you where to shoot while playing Battleship War. Written in CoffeeScript.

Usage:

- update(x, y, command) to provide information to Bot (eg: 3, 7, ["miss", "hit", "carrier", "battleship", "submarine", "destroyer" or "patrol"])

- suggest() will return a Point[x, y] with the highest probability of hit

Calculations and probailities based on "The Linear Theory of Battleship" by The Virtuosi.
